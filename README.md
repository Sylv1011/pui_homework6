Updates on this version:
1. Fixed unintentional mistakes (Last time in the last minute I changed all my home.html to index.html but forgot to change the name in the files)
2. Updated some details on product details page
    In the prototypes I forgot to have the option of materials for customers. This time I added in the radio button for users to change material. 
    Users can pick color, number and material of the product and add products to the cart
    Users can choose the pictures on the left side to make them large to view.
